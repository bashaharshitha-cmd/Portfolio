           I’m Harshitha Basha, a motivated front-end web developer in training with a strong interest in React and modern web technologies. I enjoy learning how to build clean, responsive, and user-focused websites that provide great experiences across all devices.

Guided by curiosity and a love for learning, I’m always exploring new tools, design ideas, and coding practices to grow my skills and bring creative ideas to life through code.
